# DynamicProgrammingComposer
An idea: use dynamic programming to compose  
Find out someone has a Markov Composer: http://zx.rs/3/Markov-Composer---Using-machine-learning-and-a-Markov-chain-to-compose-music/  
These two approaches have the same drawback: randomly or semi-randomly add a note based on previous (1 or 2) note(s)  
However in real music I believe every new note should be based on several previous notes. There should be a trend(like a music wave or stream) in the whole music. Need further consideration. And music should have repetition.  


## Current Problem:
notes no repetition.  
Unarycost difficult to design because no composing experience.
